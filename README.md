# üè¶ Bank Summary Report Automation using Python & Pandas

## ‚úÖ Project Goal

To automate the creation of a consolidated **Bank Summary Report** by processing and merging data from multiple bank files. The script simulates a real world finance process where manual data entry is replaced with efficient Python automation.

### üìã Business Rule Applied:
If **Earning Credit Rate (ECR)** = `0%`,  
‚Üí then **set the amount in AFP Code `000040` to 0**.  
Otherwise, keep the amount as it is.

---

## üìå Key Features

- Reads multiple customer Excel files from a folder (`Customer details/`)
- Extracts relevant fields: **Account Number**, **AFP Code**, and **Balance Information**
- Automatically updates required data according to the business rule in `Working File.xlsx` and also adds **new entries** if not present
- Enhances time efficiency by reducing manual data entry and streamlining the reporting process
- Works well for finance operations, treasury, and account summary automation tasks.

## üíº Business Logic Implemented

This project simulates how a real financial analyst or back-office team would automate summary reports using rule-based logic:

- ‚úÖ **Only new account records** are added to the master report (`Working File.xlsx`)
- üß† **Duplicate entries are ignored** to prevent redundancy
- üîé Extracts data based on **business-relevant fields**:  
  - **AFP Code** from a specific row/column  
  - **Balance info** from ‚ÄúBalance Information‚Äù section
- ‚öôÔ∏è Handles inconsistencies in Excel file formats and sheet layouts
- üìÅ Automates bulk processing of many customer files in one go ‚Äî saving time and effort
